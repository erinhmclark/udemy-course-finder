# udemy-course-finder

An example scraper project which collects course information from Udemy.

### Version 0.1

This displays a simplified scraper extracting content from some pre-stored HTML from the URL:
[https://www.udemy.com/topic/python/](https://www.udemy.com/topic/python/)

The result is then stored (in it's basic format) in a csv file.
