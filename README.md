# udemy-course-finder

An example scraper project which collects course information from Udemy.

## Version 0.1

This displays a simplified scraper extracting content from some pre-stored HTML from the URL:
[https://www.udemy.com/topic/python/](https://www.udemy.com/topic/python/)

The result is then stored (in its basic format) in a csv file.

## Setup

This project is using a [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) environment for its requirements. 
Install this if needed, and then run:
```commandline
poetry install
```
